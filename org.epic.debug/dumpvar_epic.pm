__DATA__

=pod
=head1 dumpvar_epic.pm

This module is invoked by EPIC to dump contents of Perl variables in order to
present them in the Variables view of the debugger.

=head1 Dumpable entities 

The I<entities> dumpable by this module can be classified as follows:

=over

=item * Type 1: lexical variables

=item * Type 2: key-value pairs of a hash

=item * Type 3: elements of a list

=back

=head1 Format of a dumped entity

The dump format is designed to be reasonably concise and easy to parse
while remaining human-readable to support debugging the debugger.

An entity is dumped by printing a series of tokens. Each token is a utf8
string and is preceded by its length expressed as a decimal integer.
Tokens, as well as the token length and token content, are separated
from each other with a pipe (vertical bar) character. Thus, the string
C<"3|abc"> would contain a single three-character long token with value
C<abc>, while the string C<"3|abc|2|de"> would contain two tokens, C<abc>
and C<de>. The explicit token lengths solve the parsing difficulty
caused by pipe characters potentially appearing inside of the token values.
(Another way would have been to use escaping and un-escaping of separator
characters, but it appeared less efficient and more cumbersome to implement.)
In the following description the token lengths are omitted for clarity.

The tokens which comprise a dumped entity are explained next,
in the order in which they appear in the dump (examples are provided
in the last section of this document):

=over

=item 1. (single token)

entity name

=over

=item *

a qualified name of a lexical variable (C<$x>, C<@x>, C<%x>) OR

=item *

an unqualified name of a hash key (C<x>) OR

=item *

an index of a list element (C<0>, C<1>, C<2>, ...)

=back

=item 2. (single token)

number of tokens comprising "entity address and reference chain" that follows

=item 3. (multiple tokens)

entity address and reference chain

The entity address is the address reported by Perl's built-in C<ref>
function for a hypothetical variable which could be dereferenced
using the C<${...}> operator to assign a new value to the entity.
If the entity itself is a reference, the address of the referenced
entity will be output in the following token, recursively until
either an address of a non-reference entity is finally output or
a cycle in the reference chain is detected. The final address in
the reference chain denotes the value type or is equal to the first
address in case of a circular reference chain.

=item 4. (single token)

entity value

=over

=item *

If the entity is not a reference:

=over

=item *

C<undef> (unquoted literal) for entities with an undefined value

=item *

C<...> (unquoted three dots literal) for hashes and lists

=item *

a singly quoted string value (C<'foo'>) for all other entities

=back

=item *

If the entity is a reference:

=over

=item *

the dumped value is of the final non-reference entity in the reference chain OR

=item *

C<cycle> (unquoted literal) in case of a circular reference chain OR

=item *

singly quoted value (C<'foo'>) of a referenced Perl object which supports
stringification

=back

=back

=item 5. (single token)

character length of the entity value

The total number of Unicode characters (as reported by Perl's length
function) comprising the full string value of the dumped entity.
The artificially inserted surrounding quotes are not counted.
This number can be evaluated in EPIC to determine whether the string value
was truncated before dumping.

=back

If multiple entities are dumped in a single request from EPIC (e.g. all elements
of a list or all key-value pairs of a hash), then each entity's tokens are followed
by a C<\n> (line feed) character.

=head1 Examples

This section contains some normative examples of dumps for the various entity
types. Each example consists of a line which assigns a value to the entity
and the dumped representation of the entity on the second line. Again, note
that the string lengths that in reality appear in front of each token are
skipped here for clarity.
