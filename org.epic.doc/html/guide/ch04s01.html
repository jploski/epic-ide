    <p>Each Workbench window contains one or more perspectives. A perspective defines the initial
    set and layout of views in the Workbench window. Within the window, each perspective shares the
    same set of editors. Each perspective provides a set of capabilities aimed at accomplishing a
    specific type of task or works with specific types of resources. For example, the Java
    perspective combines views that you would commonly use while editing Java source files, while
    the Debug perspective contains the views that you would use while debugging Java programs. As
    you work in the Workbench, you will probably switch perspectives frequently.</p>
    <p>Perspectives control what appears in certain menus and toolbars. They define visible
    <span class="emphasis"><em>action sets</em></span>, which you can change to customize a
    perspective. You can save a perspective that you build in this manner, making your own custom
    perspective that you can open again later.</p>
    <p>You can set your Workbench preferences to open perspectives in the same window or in a new
    window.</p>
    <p>The main perspectives for developing Perl applications are:</p>
    <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/perl_perspective_symbol.gif" alt=
    "Perl Perspective"></span> This is the main perspective for coding Perl scripts.</p>
    <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="images/debug_perspective_symbol.gif" alt=
    "Debug Perspective"></span> Provides the main functionality for debugging and executing Perl
    scripts. For details see <a class="xref" href="ch06s04.html" title=
    "Views in the Debug Perspective">the section called “Views in the Debug Perspective”</a>.</p>
